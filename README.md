# Used_Cars --> See Used Cars Report in Repo
This project analyzes a large used car dataset from Kaggle to identify the key factors influencing vehicle prices. Using a 426K-record subset for scalable modeling, regression and machine learning methods are applied to deliver data-driven pricing insights for a used car dealership.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was provided as part of a University of California, Berkeley
Machine Learning course. The data represents a curated subset derived from a publicly
available Kaggle used cars dataset and is intended for educational and non-commercial use.

Original data source:
- Kaggle Used Cars Dataset (derived subset)
- Used in accordance with course and dataset licensing terms
